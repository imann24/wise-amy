                    There is a certain Amy of great wisdom who roams the land.
                    Sadly, her sage knowledge is scattered far and wide to the
                    four winds. Never until now has one site endeavored to
                    bring together all her genius.

                    Magical Girl I always think of as a type of anime? You can guess what they’re about

                <p>
                    A Mary Sue is a female character who is Super Awesome and Talented
                    Out of Nowhere and All The Boys Like Her. A whole army of women online
                    HATED these characters, but then one day someone said, “hey, doesn’t
                    that describe James Bond and like every male hero ever?” And we all
                    took a moment to grapple with our own misogyny. In modern times, it’s
                    how Nerd Boys(TM) justify hating characters like Rey, because “she’s
                    too good at things it doesn’t make sense, I don’t hate her bc she’s a
                    woman I hate her bc she’s a Mary Sue” despite the fact that Rey has
                    been beating people up w a stick for years and Luke was Super Good
                    at Glow Sticks after one lesson
                </p>
                <p>
                    (That was also what people called self-inserts in fanfics where you’d
                    add a new female character that is everything you wished you were to a
                    franchise. She’d then date all the characters you thought were hot, etc.
                    such a work in the One Direction fandom just became a movie, so... yeah.
                    Weird times. But also people write to have fun and they should do what
                    they want)
